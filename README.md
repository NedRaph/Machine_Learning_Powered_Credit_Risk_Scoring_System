Machine_Learning_Powered_Credit_Risk_Scoring_System
## Executive Summary
Credit risk assessment is a critical process in the financial services industry. Inaccurate risk evaluation can lead to significant financial losses due to defaults, while overly conservative models can reduce lending opportunities.
This project delivers a data-driven credit risk scoring model leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate, scalable, and explainable risk predictions.

The system is designed for integration into lending workflows, enabling institutions to optimize approval rates while maintaining portfolio quality.

## Business Problem
Traditional credit scoring models often rely on static thresholds and outdated methodologies. These approaches:

- Fail to capture evolving borrower behaviors.

- May introduce bias or inefficiency into lending decisions.

- Struggle with large, high-dimensional datasets.

## Project Objective
The objective is to develop a robust, adaptive model that predicts the likelihood of loan default and outputs an interpretable credit score, reducing default rates while enabling responsible lending growth.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains historical loan records with borrower demographics, loan characteristics, and repayment histories.
